DeepBlock provides deep learning tool for everyone. You can just pick application you want, upload your dataset, make annotations for training and click the run button. While code runs in deep block server, you can do anything with your computer. 

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample results for style transfer appication" %}

We provide some simple applications like style transfer, above images for example, facial expression recognition, etc.
Also we provide image segmentation and object Detection application with annotation tool which makes annotation as coco json format.
You can make dataset and train model in one page.
